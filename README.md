# Ambience
![App Demo](./assets/images/ambience-demo.gif)

The application is to create an immersive experience for a person to easily create an ambiance for either a special occasion or for their own enjoyment. When they arrive on the site, the first thing they see is a form that will intuitively allow them move through selecting a protein to build a meal around, displaying ingredients from a random recipe with a complementary wine pairing. 


## User story
AS AN indecisive eater I WANT TO  select a protein SO THAT I can receive a randomized recipe to build a meal around and a complimentary wine pairing. 

## Technologies
> HTML, CSS, JS
> APIs: spoontactular & getcooking.io

## Further Development
In the future there are plans for several feature additions to improve user experience:
- displaying a full recipe card (and also continue displaying ingredients)
- adding dessert options 
- add an api that handles music playlists to create an overall immersive experience
